# PHP Gallery
This a learning project for me to learn the syntax, features and best practices of object-oriented php.  
The folder structure template is from an Udemy course I took.

## My disclaimer
Be warned this is only a learning project. All code residing in this project and or repo is my attempt to learn php.  
So it is possible that some code maybe not best practice or standard.
